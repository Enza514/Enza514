### Hi there, Hello 😄

### I am a Computer Science Major and recent grad who has been working in the video games QA field for the last 10 years

- ⚙️ I use `C/C++` and `Python` for most of my own projects, and plan on adding more here not that I have more free time! 😊 
- ℹ️ I am familiar with most database tools for entering and managing issues, like Jira, Zephyr, etc.
- 🗣️ Let's talk about **Games** and **AI**, these are two of my greatest interest at the moment, although I only know a little bit about AI.
- 🔭 I’m currently working on a project to assist my GM'ing TTRPGs.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Automation, Machine Learning, and more in-depth Python.
